GoogleReaderAPI
===============

Still a work in progress. What is working so far?

 * you can see which feeds you are subscribed to.
 * you can subscribe and unsubscribe to feeds.
 * you can get the unread items and the unread count for every feed.
 * you can toggle readstate, like, star of entries
 
So far that's about it.
What's left to be done is a huge list.
